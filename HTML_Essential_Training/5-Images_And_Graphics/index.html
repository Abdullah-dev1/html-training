<!-- images -->

<!-- There are some attributes (exactly 4) that are used in  every image (ie, src(source), alt(alternate), width, height ) -->

<!-- "src" attribute is just like href attribute, but the only difference is that we have to put iimage links instead or websites URLs. -->

<!-- "alt" attribute is used whenever for some reason the image can't be shown the alternate text takes its place (it is also useful for screen readers ). -->

<!-- IMAGE FORMAT -->

<!-- Images are used a lot in HTML files, but the image file size needs to be very small in order to download fast. -->

<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- "GIF" This format does well compressing large areas of a single color, 
    It has limited color space of 256 colors,
     It can also be transparent but it will have jagged edges,
      It can have multiple frames thus it can be animated -->
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- "SVG" (Scalable Vector Graphic), It is useful in making loos, icons, etc,
    unlike "GIF" it is a vector file, 
     Because it works on vector and math it can be really small or really big without getting pixelated, 
      it's file size is very small,   -->
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- "JPG" It is known for being a great format for compressing photos,
    "JPG" can be compressed to a smaller size but its qualiy will drop, -->
<!----------------------------------------------------------------->
<!-- "PNG" format helps with the images that need tranparency,
    "PNG" is a newer format than "GIF" or "JPG",
      It sometimes does a greter job in compressing the images of the "GIF" format,
       It also does a greater job in compressing the images of the "JPG" format,
        But not always it depeds on the usage  -->

<!-- RESPONSIVE IMAGES -->

<!-- when a image is displayed on the web, it is diffeent on different types of screen thus the qualiy drops.
              To fix this we can use the following code -->

<!-- "Srcset attribute" it allows us to specify multiple files to be used based on either viewport width or image pixel width  -->

<!-- RESPONSIVE WIDTH -->

<!-- In this way the computer chooses the right viewport width as well as the density of the pic.
    This is much faster because the computer downloads the image before the page even loads in,
     To do this we are going to use the size attribute. -->

<!-- "Sizes Attribute" it listswhich size image to use at which media query. -->
