<!-- To show subtitles, we'll use the "track" element inside the video element with the "src" attribute pointing to the file location,
    The "Kind" attribute is used to tell the computer that these are subtitles,
     The "Label" attribute is used to tell the uuer visually in the options about the language of the subtitles,
      The "srclang" attribute is used to tell the computer about the language of the subtitles. -->
